This cop detects the use of `KEYS` query that should be noted when used in a production environment.
Consider using `SCAN` query instead of `KEYS` query.
See https://redis.io/commands/keys/ for details.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
Redis.current.keys("pattern-*")

# good
cursor = 0
all_keys = []
loop do
  cursor, keys = Redis.current.scan(cursor, match: "pattern-*")
  all_keys += keys
  break if cursor == "0"
end
