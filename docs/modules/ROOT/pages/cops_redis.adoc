This cop detects the use of `KEYS` query that should be noted when used in a production environment.
Consider using `SCAN` query instead of `KEYS` query.
See https://redis.io/commands/keys/ for details.

To avoid detecting `Hash#keys` calling, this cop adds an offense only if a receiver of `keys` method is named `redis`.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
redis.keys("pattern-*")

# bad
Redis.new.keys("pattern-*")

# good
cursor = 0
all_keys = []
loop do
  cursor, keys = redis.scan(cursor, match: "pattern-*")
  all_keys += keys
  break if cursor == "0"
end
all_keys
